# Power
A powerful calculator app for Android.

This is my second app ever. The source code of the first one, CalcOne, sadly isn't available because someone (ðŸ™‚) deleted it from GitHub; and given that I don't have it in my local drive anymore, I'd say it's a complete loss.

But don't worry, that's not the only mistake I've made: since I've also lost the key that generates the signed `.aab` for publishing the app on the Play Store, I'm unable to update it.

For the time being, I can have this repository as a memory of what one day was a huge obstacle for me (putting all this code together to create a functioning tool that other people could use), and now is a reminder of how much I've progressed since then.

If you're interested in the story of how CalcOne and Power came to be, with me knowing literally nothing about programming back in 2018, refer to the videos below that I've recorded for my channel at the time (in Portuguese):
